# angular-tailwindcss-template

This project provides a template for an [Angular](https://angular.io) application that uses [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This was created after reading this useful blog post [Angular 10 with Tailwind CSS](https://notiz.dev/blog/angular-10-with-tailwindcss#angular-project).
